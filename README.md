# Smart Alarm
**Project Name:** **SMART ALARM**

**Problem:**

Usually, when the alarm starts we will snooze it or we will stop the alarm. Using snooze and stop options we will wake up late after 3 or 4 alarms. We wake-up 10-20mins late every day. We will be late to work.

While we are traveling on buses or subways, sometimes we fall asleep and miss our stop. To get down at the correct stop we need a location-based alarm, which alerts us before with an alarm 500mts from the destination. 

**Solution:** 
Here is the solution to these problems. “SMART ALARM” solves these problems. There is no snooze or stop button for wake-up alarm. To stop the wake-up alarm, you should walk a minimum of 20 steps (50 feet). If you do not walk for 20 steps, the alarm rings continuously. For the location-based alarm, you will get alarmed before 500mts from your destination. Using this alarm, you will not miss your destination and you will not be late to work. While we are traveling from work to home, if we want to stop at Walmart you can also use a location-based alarm.

**Project Description:**

* It consists of two parts location-based alarm and wake-up alarm

* In location-based alarm – you need to set alarm based on location by enabling GPS. It starts alarm before 500mts from the desired location.

* In wake-up alarm – you need to set time for alarm. To turn off the alarm, you need to walk at least 20 steps. There is no snooze or stop option for alarm.

**Activities Involved:**

* **Alarm type selection activity:** In this activity there are two buttons, one for setting the wake-up alarm and other for location-based alarm.

* **Setting wake-up alarm:** To set the clock for alarm.

* **Counting steps of the person:** To count the no. of steps walked by a person. A person should walk minimum 20steps or can use custom step count while setting alarm. If a person not walked for minimum 20steps the alarm will not go off.

* **Setting location-based alarm:** To set location on the map for alarm.

* **Option for switching off the alarm for location-based alarm:** In this screen, it displays “you have reached your destination” and displays an 

alarm turn off button.

* **Integrating with maps:** To track location we need maps, we need to identify all stores and stations and restaurants on Map. Should alert before 500mts from the destination.

**Persist on the app:**

* Data for Repeated alarm.

* App must be running in the background.

* App should identify all locations like restaurants, Gas stations all in the map.

* Integrate with Google maps.

* Save important locations (ex: Home, office)
